was evaluated in the ED on ___ and was discharged with 
percocet. She reports a sharp deep pain in the groin, radiating 
to the lower back and buttocks. She now reports difficulty with 
walking which brought her to the ED today. She initially was 
taking the percocet for pain given from the ED but this caused 
severe nausea and she was unable to keep any of her regular

out and missing work due to doctor's appointments. She also 
reports multiple other areas of joint pain including her 
shoulders, lower back, knees and ankles. With regards to her 
recent dx of SLE, she reports not taking the Azathioprine due to 
lack of insurance coverage. ROS is also notable for progressive

states they were witnessed by hre children. Currently has 
headache and feels nauseated, but denies photophobia. Started 
vomiting after Percocet, denies knowledge of prior narcotic 
reaction. Confirms dysphagia with solids and liquids. Son once 
thought of peforming the Heimlich on her given the severity of 
her pain. Feels very sleepy currently secondary to antiemetic

MR HEAD W & ___ CONTRAST  ___ 8:49 ___
Slightly improved or stable abnormal signal at the midbrain- 
pontine junction. This is a nonspecific finding, could be 
consistent with slow venous flow, small vessel disease from 
vasculitis such as lupus. Other remote considerations include 
toxic or metabolic causes for myelinolysis or Wernicke's 
encephalomyopathy. Although there is no susceptibility artifact, 
vascular malformation would also be potential consideration.

MR ___ CONTRAST  ___ 8:49 ___
There is no evidence of abnormality within the spinal cord; 
there is no evidence of spinal canal stenosis or neural 
foraminal narrowing. After the administration of gadolinium 
contrast, there is no evidence of abnormal enhancement. The 
signal intensity in the bone marrow is slightly hypointense 
suggesting anemic changes.

BILAT HIPS (AP,LAT & AP PELVIS)  ___ 3:18 ___
Essentially unremarkable study, with no specific evidence of 
avascular necrosis, and no subluxation, fracture or significant 
degenerative change.

MR HIP ___ CONRAST LEFT  ___ 9:43 ___
1. No evidence of osteonecrosis or fracture. Minimal fluid in 
both hip joints, but no frank effusion.
2. Mild assymetry of pirifiormis muscles noted. In the absence 
of symptoms related to the sciatic nerve, this is unlikely to 
account for the acute symptoms.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  ___ 2:51 ___
Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries. 
There is no significant plaque seen bilaterally.  On the right, 
peak velocities are 78, 77, and 54 cm/sec in the ICA, CCA, and 
ECA respectively. This is consistent with no stenosis.  On the 
left, peak velocities are 85, 106, and 73 cm/sec in the ICA, 
CCA, and ECA respectively. This is consistent with no stenosis.  
There is antegrade vertebral flow bilaterally. Normal carotid 
study.

TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 2:42:03 ___      FINAL 
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild global 
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations 
are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral 
valve. There is moderate focal nodular thickening of the mitral 
valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Mild 
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial 
effusion.  IMPRESSION: Low normal left ventricular systolic 
function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Focal thickening of the 
mitral chordae and thickening mitral valve leaflets. 

ESOPHAGUS  ___ 1:50 ___
Limited study. No evidence of achalasia or esophageal stricture. 
Findings consistent with esophageal dysmotility.

EGD ___
IMPRESSION: Medium hiatal hernia, Gastritis (biopsy), otherwise 
normal EGD to third part of the duodenum. Recommendations: 
Follow-up biopsies, increase PPI to 20mg BID (or 40mg daily), no 
explanation for symptoms on EGD. Recommend outpatient esophageal 
manometry. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: ___ F with recent dx of SLE with cerebral involvement, 
worsening seizure activity, b/l hip pain.  
  
# Hip Pain. Progressive pain leading to inability to ambulate, 
initially differential included polyarthralgia of SLE vs. 
arthritis (unlikely) vs. avascular necrosis of the hip (b/l 
would be unlikely) vs. septic joint given recent steroid use and 
relatively immunocompromised state. Given lack of other systemic 
symptoms and not exquisitely tender on exam, septic joint was 
thought to be less likely. Also complained of bilateral inguinal 
component concerning for intraabdominal process. No history of 
abnormal gynecologic findings or new sexual partners. MRI of 
hips was obtained as above to assess for avascular necrosis and 
was negative.  SLE was treated as described below.  Pain control 
was attained by scheduled Tylenol and oxycodone PRN, which she 
tolerated well.  Additionally, Rheumatology was consulted and 
recommended checking anti-centromere ab, anti-SCL 70 Ab and 
aldolase levels, all of which were pending upon discharge.  By 
discharge, pain was much improved with pain management as above, 
most consistent with arthralgia vs myalgia secondary to systemic 
disease. 

# SLE. Rheumatology consulted upon admission. Multiple 
manifestations were noted upon presentation including 
arthralgias, alopecia and CNS manifestations.  Prednisone was 
continued and Azathioprine was started.  Per Rheumatology 
recommendations, anti-centromere ab, anti-SCL 70 Ab and aldolase 
levels, were checked and all of which were pending upon 
discharge.  Additionally recommended PFTs with DLCO, which was 
not performed as an inpatient, but deferred to outpatient 
therapy.  Upon discharge, patient was overall improved and had 
scheduled outpatient follow-up.

# Seizures and loss of consciousness. Neurology consulted upon 
admission.  MRI brain and ___ were obtained in the ED and 
did reveal significant change. Initial thoughts included SLE 
cerebritis. Tegretol level was checked and found to be 
subtherapeutic, likely secondary to nausea and lack of PO 
intake. Per their recommendations, her anti-epileptic 
medications was changed to Keppra given that it can be given 
IV/po which will be an issue given her recurrent nausea with 
migraines.  Echo and carotid ultrasound were also only revealed 
mild decreased EF.  While inpatient she was started on Keppra 
with planned up titration by 500 mg BID x 3 days, then 750 mg 
BID x 3 days, then 1000 mg BID as new outpatient regimen.  She 
was additionally bridged with Ativan 0.5 mg po BID x 3 days with 
taper as outpatient.  No evidence of seizure while inpatient, 
and patient was monitored on telemetry throughout.  Also, 
continued Amitriptyline HCl 100 mg PO HS for migraines.  
  
# Dysphagia.  Concerning for overlap with Scleroderma vs. 
relation to underlying SLE. Antibodies as above. Speech and 
swallow evaluation revealed esophageal dysphagia, but no 
evidence of an oropharyngeal component. Initial considerations 
included Schatzki's ring, achalasia, thrush or other dysmotility 
syndrome. No evidence of thrush on exam but was on chronic 
steroids.  Esophageal study revealed dysmotility.  EGD was only 
revealing for mild gastritis but no other structural 
abnormality.  Biopsies were taken and pending on discharge with 
plan to follow-up with GI.  Was also to get outpatient manometry 
study, which was scheduled prior to discharge.  Thrush was 
empirically treated with Clotrimazole.  And PPI was increased to 
BID per GI.  Dysphagia had improved prior to discharge, but 
continued to have intermittent globus sensation. 

# Decreased Ejection Fraction: Noted on Echo that was obtained 
to assess for loss of consciousness.  Given this, she was 
started on low dose Metoprolol which she tolerated well.

# Tachycardia: Patient was persistently tachycardic during her 
inpatient stay.  This was thought to be due to pain and nausea.  
She remained euvolemic after initial fluid given for nausea and 
vomiting.  TSH was checked and found to be within normal limits. 
 Stable upon discharge.

# HTN. Continued propranolol and HCTZ, Metoprolol was started 
while inpatient and she was given this medication upon 
discharge.  

# GERD. PPI BID as above.  
  
# Migraines. Continued Amitriptyline. Was also given one dose of 
Imitrex which did relieve her symptoms.  Discharge on 
Amitriptyline.

Trainer.tokenizer is now deprecated. You should use Trainer.processing_class instead.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.

/root/miniconda3/envs/LLM/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pydantic/_internal/_generate_schema.py:2249: UnsupportedFieldAttributeWarning: The 'repr' attribute with value False was provided to the `Field()` function, which has no effect in the context it was used. 'repr' is field-specific metadata, and can only be attached to a model field using `Annotated` metadata or by assignment. This may have happened because an `Annotated` type alias using the `type` statement was used, or if the `Field()` function was attached to a single member of a union type.
