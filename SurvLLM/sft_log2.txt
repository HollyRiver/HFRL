Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Throat tightness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year-old man transferred from ___ for treatment of throat 
tightness and pneumonia. He is admitted to the ICU for closer 
monitoring given concern of allergic reaction and history of 
severe ___ reaction in ___.  

His current symptoms started several days ago with URI-type 
symptoms. Patient developed chest tightness, sore throat, dry 
cough, and sensation of "lips feeling leathery" and dry over the 
course of three days (since ___. He notes that his 
girlfriend was sick with URI-type symptoms and he may have 
picked something up from her.  
  
Over the weekend he had taken aspirin on-and-off for four days 
(not containing Motrin per his report). Around this time he 
developed worsening throat tightness, and he decided to go to 
___ ED for further evaluation. From ___ ED he was 
transferred to ___.  

In the ED at ___, his initial vital signs were T 97.2, HR 92, 
BP 148/108, RR 20, satting 95% RA. He was noted to be talking in 
full sentences, although his voice was hoarse. On exam, there 
was no stridor or wheezing. Labs were remarkable for a white 
count of 9.5 with 72% polys, no bands. CBC was otherwise normal 
with normal BMP. An EKG showed NSR with no ischemic changes. CXR 
showed indistinctness of the left heart border with concern of 
atalectasis versus pneumonia. Patient had already received 
ceftriaxone at OSH for concern of pneumonia and was given 
azithromycin here at ___. In addition he received 4 mg of 
Zofran, 4 mg of morphine and 125 mg of methylprednisolone. 
During his time in the ED he felt increasing throat tightness, 
and due to the complicated history of ___ reaction, 
he was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. Vitals at time 
of transfer were T 97.8, HR 80, BP 140/80, RR 18, satting 97% 
RA.  
  
Of note, in ___ the patient was admitted to ___ for SJS 
involving the airway mucosa- his hospital course was complicated 
by DVT and LUL pulmonary embolism. He had a long admission 
requiring intubation (from ___ to ___ and ultimately 
tracheostomy placement. He had presented originally with SOB and 
fever three months after treatment of pneumonia with ceftriaxone 
and levofloxacin. At presentation he had a vesicular rash. His 
micro work-up was all negative with the exception of an elevated 
IgM and IgG for Mycoplasma pneumonia. He had a deep skin biopsy 
that showed erythema multiforme. He was initially treated with 
vancomycin, acyclovir, ceftriaxone, which was later changed to 
levofloxacin, and then to azithromycin (for a 21-day course 
total of antibiotics). During the admission, he had thick 
blood-tinged expectorant from his lungs felt to be consistent 
with desquamation caused by ___ syndrome. Note is 
made from that discharge summary that he had a very traumatic 
intubation and that the anesthesiologist performing the 
procedure saw a desquamated, ulcerated, and "raw-appearing" 
posterior pharynx.

possible SJS. HE was notably tachycardic and dehydrated on exam, 
he was given 2liters of IVF and HR trended down with increased 
UOP.  Pt was started on nebs and reported improved breathing and 
cough. Due to abnormal findings on CT chest from ___, he

nodules and subtle ___ opacities.  Levofloxacin was 
initially continued for CAP and pt was called out to floor but
