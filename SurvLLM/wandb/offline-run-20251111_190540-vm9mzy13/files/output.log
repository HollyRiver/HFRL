Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to
___.  You were admitted with cellulitis of the face and upper
lip which required both IV antibiotics and a drainage procedure.
 This infection was not caused by MRSA (as you had in the past).
 You responded well to this treatment.  When you go home you
should apply warm compresses to your nose/lip each day.  You
will continue taking antibiotics.  You will take Clindamycin
150mg, three tablets, four times a day (total of 12 tablets
daily) for 14 days.  You should take this complete course of
antibiotics even if your swelling/redness completely resolves.
You were also given an antibiotic ointment (Mupirocin) to put in
both nostril cavities twice a day for two weeks.  It is
important that you have your nose checked by a doctor early next
week.  If you cannot be seen by Dr. ___
(neurosurgeon), as you request, please call your primary doctor
to schedule an urgent follow up. You can continue to shave as
you did before, with careful attention paid to the
upperlip/nasal area and a clean razor each time.
Lastly, your blood pressure medicine has been changed.  When you
return home, please do not take Lisinopril.  You will start
taking Amlodipine 5mg tablet daily for your blood pressure
control.
You should seek urgent medical attention if you become febrile,
notice worsening swelling of the nose/lip face, or any other
concerning changes on the face.

Trainer.tokenizer is now deprecated. You should use Trainer.processing_class instead.
The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
