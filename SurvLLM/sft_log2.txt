                            **FINAL REPORT ___

   HIV-1 Viral Load/Ultrasensitive (Final ___: 
      HIV-1 RNA is not detected. 
      Performed using the Cobas Ampliprep / Cobas Taqman HIV-1 
Test v2.0. 
      Detection Range: ___ copies/mL. 
      This test is approved for monitoring HIV-1 viral load in 
known
      HIV-positive patients. It is not approved for diagnosis of 
acute HIV
      infection. 
      In symptomatic acute HIV infection (acute retroviral 
syndrome), the
      viral load is usually very high (>>1000 copies/mL). If 
acute HIV
      infection is clinically suspected and there is a 
detectable but low
      viral load, please contact the laboratory for 
interpretation. 
      It is recommended that any NEW positive HIV-1 viral load 
result, in
      the absence of positive serology, be confirmed by 
submitting a new
      sample FOR HIV-1 PCR, in addition to serological testing. 

IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
CTA ___ chest/abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
 
1. No acute aortic pathology. Specifically, there is no aortic 
aneurysm or dissection. 
2. No acute pulmonary embolus. 
3. Minimal pulmonary edema and atelectasis. 
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis. 

CXR ___. Low lung volumes and minimal bronchovascular crowding and 
edema. 
2. No focal pneumonia or pneumothorax. 

STRESS ___
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with a history of NSTEMI 
___, 
HIV, HTN and HL was referred to the lab from the ER following 
negative serial cardiac markers for evaluation of chest 
discomfort and syncope. 
The patient exercised for 9.5 minutes of ___ protocol and 
stopped 
for fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 10.5 which 
represents an average functional capacity for his age. No arm, 
neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient 
during exercise. At 3 minutes of recovery, he noted a left sided 
___ chest discomfort that resolved with rest by 5 minutes of 
recovery. No ST segment changes were observed during exercise. 
At 3 minutes of recovery, there was 0.5-1 mm 
horizontal/downsloping STD in V4-6. This resolved by 7 minutes 
of recovery. The rhythm was sinus with 1 apb. Appropriate 
hemodynamic response to exercise and recovery on beta blocker 
therapy. 

CARDIAC CATH ___
Coronary Anatomy
Dominance: Left
* Left Main Coronary Artery
The LMCA is normal.
* Left Anterior Descending
The LAD is normal.
* Circumflex
The Circumflex is dominant.
The ___ Marginal has a 50% stenosis with a benign FFR of 0.91.
The left PDA has a 90% stenosis.
* Right Coronary Artery
The RCA is nondominant and normal.

Impressions:
Successful PCI of PDA branch of dominant Cx with 2.25 by 12 
Promus with good result.
Benign FFR of OM1.

Recommendations
ASA and plavix.
Aggrastat for 4 hrs.

TTE ___
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. Normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size, and regional/global systolic function (biplane LVEF = 60 
%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly 
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. No 
pericardial effusion identified. Mildly dilated aortic sinus. 

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.

CTA HEAD/NECK ___. 3.6 x 4.8 cm mixed density left frontal intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage with substantial mass effect resulting in partial 
effacement of the left lateral ventricle and third ventricles 
and rightward 1 cm shift of normally midline structures.  There 
is effacement of the bilateral perimesencephalic cisterns, 
concern for herniation. 
2. The right ventricle demonstrates enlarged temporal horn, 
concerning for 
entrapment and developing hydrocephalus. 
3. There is extension of hemorrhage into the left lateral 
ventricle with 
hyperdense blood also seen within the fourth ventricle and the 
quadrigeminal plate cistern. 
4. A hyperdense subdural hematoma along the left lateral 
convexity measuring approximately 8 mm in maximum dimension from 
the inner table. 
5. Head CTA is notable for complete lack of visualization of the 
P3 branches of the left posterior cerebral artery and partial 
effacement of the A2 branch of the left anterior cerebral artery 
from extensive mass effect and midline shift. 
6. A 1-2 mm outpouching arising from the medial aspect of the 
left cavernous internal carotid artery may represent an 
infundibulum of a branch vessel however a tiny aneurysm cannot 
be excluded. 
7. Unremarkable neck CTA. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M hx HIV, HTN, HL, NSTEMI ___ treated medically in past, 
who was admitted with sudden onset chest pain and syncope s/p 
positive stress test ___. Underwent cardiac catheterization 
on ___ with DES to PDA. Subsequently had a syncopal episode with 
nausea/diaphoresis on ___ with sinus pause (5 seconds, 11 
seconds) after returning from cardiac catheterization and was 
transferred to the CCU. Sinus pause thought to be related to AV 
nodal dysfunction ___ catheterization vs. vasovagal episode. EKG 
and R sided EKG were performed, which did not show any evidence 
of ischemia. Pt was started on metoprolol on ___ (6.25 q 6 
hours) and received one dose on the morning of the ___. Of note, 
post-cath labs revealed platelet count of 5. 

Shortly after arrival to CCU, patient was noted to have 
decreased alertness and difficulty following commands. He had 
received 100 mcg fentanyl during case and was originally thought 
his AMS may be due to an adverse effect of fentanyl, however 
concern for bleeding secondary to severe thrombocytopenia 
prompted further evaluation. A stroke code was called. Neurology 
evaluated the patient and agreed that a stat head noncontrast CT 
was necessary. CT scan revealed intraparenchymal hemorrhage of 
frontal lobe (left), blood into lateral and left fourth 
ventricle, subdural hemorrhage over entire left cerebral 
convexity and along the falx, and 1.5 cm of R ward shift and 
effacement of the basal cisterns.

Neurosurgery saw the patient immediately and determined that 
intervention would be futile. They recommended platelet 
transfusion and medications to control intracranial pressure 
until the family could be present at the bedside. Patient's 
family in ___ was notified of the situation and made travel 
arrangements. In the interim, patient developed central Diabetes 
Insipidus with hypernatremia, and further electrolyte 
abnormalities stemming from increased urine output. This was 
treated with ddAVP, insulin, and free water, along with 
electrolyte repletion. Electrolyte abnormalities were resolved 
by the time the family arrived. No definitive cause of the 
incident was determined. The family determined the patient would 
be made CMO. He was extubated and expired peacefully within 
minutes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ yo F with COPD on oxygen and multifocal 
adenocarcinoma of the lung followed conservatively with imaging 
who is transferred from OSH with dyspnea and new hemopysis.  
 
ACUTE ISSUES:  
# Hemoptysis: Differential diagnosis includes infection vs 
bleeding from tumor mass vs PE. Favor tumor given lack of clear 
infectious symptoms and no clear evidence of DVT on exam. In 
comparison with her prior scans, it seems that there has been 
interval worsening of her tumor burden. The interventional 
pulmonary service was consulted and a bronchoscopy was performed 
on ___ for possible coagulation of bleeding. Findings included 2 
small telangiectasias which were coagulated and no large source 
of bleeding that could be identified. She was treated for 
possible community acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone/azithro 
as her scans are difficult to to evaluate for infection given 
multifocal malignancy. She never had an elevated WBC count or 
fevers while hospitalized but in light of her worsening dyspnea 
on exertion and her hemoptysis she will continue to be covered 
with levofloxacin as an outpatient to complete a course of 
pneumonia with the last day of antibiotics being ___. She was 
encouraged to return to ___ promptly if she has any further 
episodes of hemoptysis.

# Dyspnea: Multiple possible etiologies: could consider 
worsening tumor burden +/- PNA, pneumonitis from hemorrhage, 
COPD exacerbation, PE, or cardiac cause. Favor tumor burden with 
possible pneumonitis. Notably, is on chronic prednisone without 
PCP prophylaxis so bactrim was initiated while admitted and 
should be continued as an outpatient. There was low concern for 
cardiac etiolgoy of her dyspnea as she had negative troponins on 
admission and had no events on telemetry. Her home COPD regimen 
of advair, prednisone, tiotroprium, and albuterol nebs PRN was 
continued. 

# Lung Cancer-It seems that her tumor burden is increasing which 
suggests she may require treatment in the future. She should 
follow up with her primary oncologist to discuss her options if 
she desires treatment.  

# Hypothryoidism-Stable, home levothyroxine continued.  

Transitional Issues:
-The patient was treated with bactrim for PCP prophylaxis as she 
has been taking chronic prednisone without PCP ___. She 
should continue this medication as long as she is receiving 
prednisone.
-Please ensure the patient is able to cope at home as she has

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___, 

You were transfered to ___ because you were coughing up blood. 
This resolved on its own. There are two likely casues of this: 
(1) infection, which we are treating with antibiotics and (2) 
your cancer, for which you underwent a bronchoscopy. This didn't 
show any active bleeding, though two small potential areas of 
bleed were cauterized. As you are no longer coughing up blood, 
we are sending you home with antibotics. Please continue taking 
your levofloxacin as prescribed through ___. We also are 
sending you home with a new antibiotic called bactrim because 
you are on long term steroids and this antibiotic can prevent a 
dangerous lung infection. You should take it daily while you are 
on prednisone. If you cough up blood again, come to the hospital 
immeadiately, so a bronchoscopy can be done with 24 hours of the 
bleed. We wish you all the best in your continued care.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team
