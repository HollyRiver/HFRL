Attending: ___.
Chief Complaint:
Throat tightness
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
History of Present Illness:
___ year-old man transferred from ___ for treatment of throat
tightness and pneumonia. He is admitted to the ICU for closer
monitoring given concern of allergic reaction and history of
severe ___ reaction in ___.
His current symptoms started several days ago with URI-type
symptoms. Patient developed chest tightness, sore throat, dry
cough, and sensation of "lips feeling leathery" and dry over the
course of three days (since ___. He notes that his
girlfriend was sick with URI-type symptoms and he may have
picked something up from her.
Over the weekend he had taken aspirin on-and-off for four days
(not containing Motrin per his report). Around this time he
developed worsening throat tightness, and he decided to go to
___ ED for further evaluation. From ___ ED he was
transferred to ___.
In the ED at ___, his initial vital signs were T 97.2, HR 92,
BP 148/108, RR 20, satting 95% RA. He was noted to be talking in
full sentences, although his voice was hoarse. On exam, there
was no stridor or wheezing. Labs were remarkable for a white
count of 9.5 with 72% polys, no bands. CBC was otherwise normal
with normal BMP. An EKG showed NSR with no ischemic changes. CXR
showed indistinctness of the left heart border with concern of
atalectasis versus pneumonia. Patient had already received
ceftriaxone at OSH for concern of pneumonia and was given
azithromycin here at ___. In addition he received 4 mg of
Zofran, 4 mg of morphine and 125 mg of methylprednisolone.
During his time in the ED he felt increasing throat tightness,
and due to the complicated history of ___ reaction,
he was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring. Vitals at time
of transfer were T 97.8, HR 80, BP 140/80, RR 18, satting 97%
RA.
Of note, in ___ the patient was admitted to ___ for SJS
involving the airway mucosa- his hospital course was complicated
by DVT and LUL pulmonary embolism. He had a long admission
requiring intubation (from ___ to ___ and ultimately
tracheostomy placement. He had presented originally with SOB and
fever three months after treatment of pneumonia with ceftriaxone
and levofloxacin. At presentation he had a vesicular rash. His
micro work-up was all negative with the exception of an elevated
IgM and IgG for Mycoplasma pneumonia. He had a deep skin biopsy
that showed erythema multiforme. He was initially treated with
vancomycin, acyclovir, ceftriaxone, which was later changed to
levofloxacin, and then to azithromycin (for a 21-day course
total of antibiotics). During the admission, he had thick
blood-tinged expectorant from his lungs felt to be consistent
with desquamation caused by ___ syndrome. Note is
made from that discharge summary that he had a very traumatic
intubation and that the anesthesiologist performing the
procedure saw a desquamated, ulcerated, and "raw-appearing"
posterior pharynx.

Trainer.tokenizer is now deprecated. You should use Trainer.processing_class instead.
The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
